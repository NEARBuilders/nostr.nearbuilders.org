 * Single BuzzAdapter instance per plugin lifetime. Previously `getAdapter("buzz")`
 * in NostrCommentService constructed a fresh adapter on every call (each with
 * its own WebSocket connections) and never closed the per-call instances. The
 * layer-scoped service here constructs ONCE and the framework's scope cleanup
 * closes it on plugin shutdown.
 *
 * Service value is Option<BuzzAdapter>: None when BUZZ_NSEC/BUZZ_RELAYS are not
 * configured. The plugin still initializes cleanly in standard-only mode; the
 * NostrCommentService.getAdapter helper short-circuits with a BAD_REQUEST in
 * that case.
